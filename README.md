mumax3 TACC autoinstaller + userguide
=========================================================
developed for inclab

**DOWNLOAD**

First, one should create a mumax folder somewhere on /work/.
Get the zip archive direct link from the box or github or email, enter your mumax folder, and type `wget [direct link to file]`.
Can also do `module load git` and `git clone [line to this git repo]` to get the files without having to extract.
Maybe use git if you ever want to contribute back to this repository, and modify scripts and improve them for the group.


**INSTALLATION**
 - If using zip file:
To extract, type `unzip [filename]`.
 - If using git:
    1. module load git -> git clone [etc etc.git]
    2. perform `cd install-mumax3-tacc` ... or maybe it's just `cd install`
    3. To install, one should type (exactly) `. ./install.sh`
    4. There should be little else that needs to be done. This will download and extract a precompiled binary, and set up the environment to run the scripts.
    5. This will also add the necessary paths to your .bashrc file automatically.


**RUNNING SIMULATIONS**

A wrapper script will handle the actual slurm `sbatch [slurm script]` calls, prepare to copy to /scratch/, can provide documentation, and will name/date your simulations.
After running on /scratch/, your simulations will be copied back to /work/.../outputs/.  to use, type

    bash mumax3.sh [name of slurm script you want to call] [filename of mumax3 file]

The slurm scripts end in a .sl suffix, and can be created with the particular parameters you need (compute time, nodes, tasks, etc). Please change the email.
Please change the email.
A general purpose `general-mumax3.sl` sbatch script is provided.
The systems you want to simulate might be created in new folders in /systems/. A template system is provided. Might change it for your needs.



**SCRIPTS**

For fun, I included one of my general-purpose plotting scripts. This will plot the first column of data against the second column of data, and can be modified.
I am unsure if this helps, but I hope so. Call it with `bash plot.sh`. May need to module load python or module load matplotlib, it is a very old and ugly script and may need tweaking to run here.
Happy to help you get it working though, it is very very useful and imo matplotlib >>>>>> matlab for plotting :P
